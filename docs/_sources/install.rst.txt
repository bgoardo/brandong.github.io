INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

You will need to download the application from this link - `Link <https://mega.nz/file/sRJmwCqK#FqKY9V5CDOUbeqiCqnyo_KnXPpuxcJIEcWE8N-nSfUw>`_

After downloading the .exe, just gotta run it, where the screen should have this progression bar on it.

On the next page, you will go ahead and select which model SAAB you have. For example, I have a 2006 SAAB 9-3, so I would select the 
9-3(9440), as it is the newer itteration of the 9-3 model line.

You will then select the year of your car, and after that, you will 
be in it all the way.

This is where you would go if you need to know how to perform a specific fix or repair.

Near the top of the screen are 11 icons representing different things.

You would need to go to the specific section where the issue is coming from, then figure out what you need to do in order to properly diagnose the issue.

There is really not much to it
