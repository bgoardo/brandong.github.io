=============
Hello, I hope that things are going well with you. Today, I will be explaining how to install 
use the software known as WIS, or SAAB Workshop Information System. To put it simply, it is 
an application that has a whole lot of information on SAAB's, such as when to do routine 
maintanance, how various values should read, as well as how to perform repairs. It is a very 
handy thing to have, especially since there are not too many people who are able to work on SAAB's
nowadays, so the owners typically have to do the work themselves. Well, time to get into it.
